.SH "NAME"
shadow \- shadowed password file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
shadow
is a file which contains the password information for the system\*(Aqs accounts and optional aging information\&.
.PP
This file must not be readable by regular users if password security is to be maintained\&.
.PP
Each line of this file contains 9 fields, separated by colons (\(lq:\(rq), in the following order:
.PP
\fBlogin name\fR
.RS 4
It must be a valid account name, which exist on the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBencrypted password\fR
.RS 4
Refer to
\fBcrypt\fR(3)
for details on how this string is interpreted\&.
.sp
If the password field contains some string that is not a valid result of
\fBcrypt\fR(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other means)\&.
.sp
This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are required to authenticate as the specified login name\&. However, some applications which read the
/etc/shadow
file may decide not to permit any access at all if the password field is empty\&.
.sp
A password field which starts with a exclamation mark means that the password is locked\&. The remaining characters on the line represent the password field before the password was locked\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdate of last password change\fR
.RS 4
The date of the last password change, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970\&.
.sp
The value 0 has a special meaning, which is that the user should change her pasword the next time she will log in the system\&.
.sp
An empty field means that password aging features are disabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBminimum password age\fR
.RS 4
The minimum password age is the number of days the user will have to wait before she will be allowed to change her password again\&.
.sp
An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no minimum password age\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmaximum password age\fR
.RS 4
The maximum password age is the number of days after which the user will have to change her password\&.
.sp
After this number of days is elapsed, the password may still be valid\&. The user should be asked to change her password the next time she will log in\&.
.sp
An empty field means that there are no maximum password age, no password warning period, and no password inactivity period (see below)\&.
.sp
If the maximum password age is lower than the minimum password age, the user cannot change her password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpassword warning period\fR
.RS 4
The number of days before a password is going to expire (see the maximum password age above) during which the user should be warned\&.
.sp
An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no password warning period\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpassword inactivity period\fR
.RS 4
The number of days after a password has expired (see the maximum password age above) during which the password should still be accepted (and the user should update her password during the next login)\&.
.sp
After expiration of the password and this expiration period is elapsed, no login is possible using the current user\*(Aqs password\&. The user should contact her administrator\&.
.sp
An empty field means that there are no enforcement of an inactivity period\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBaccount expiration date\fR
.RS 4
The date of expiration of the account, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970\&.
.sp
Note that an account expiration differs from a password expiration\&. In case of an acount expiration, the user shall not be allowed to login\&. In case of a password expiration, the user is not allowed to login using her password\&.
.sp
An empty field means that the account will never expire\&.
.sp
The value 0 should not be used as it is interpreted as either an account with no expiration, or as an expiration on Jan 1, 1970\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreserved field\fR
.RS 4
This field is reserved for future use\&.
.RE
