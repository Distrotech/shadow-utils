.SH "NAME"
login.defs \- shadow password suite configuration
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
/etc/login\&.defs
file defines the site\-specific configuration for the shadow password suite\&. This file is required\&. Absence of this file will not prevent system operation, but will probably result in undesirable operation\&.
.PP
This file is a readable text file, each line of the file describing one configuration parameter\&. The lines consist of a configuration name and value, separated by whitespace\&. Blank lines and comment lines are ignored\&. Comments are introduced with a "#" pound sign and the pound sign must be the first non\-white character of the line\&.
.PP
Parameter values may be of four types: strings, booleans, numbers, and long numbers\&. A string is comprised of any printable characters\&. A boolean should be either the value
\fIyes\fR
or
\fIno\fR\&. An undefined boolean parameter or one with a value other than these will be given a
\fIno\fR
value\&. Numbers (both regular and long) may be either decimal values, octal values (precede the value with
\fI0\fR) or hexadecimal values (precede the value with
\fI0x\fR)\&. The maximum value of the regular and long numeric parameters is machine\-dependent\&.
.PP
The following configuration items are provided:
.PP
\fBCHFN_AUTH\fR (boolean)
.RS 4
If
\fIyes\fR, the
\fBchfn\fR
program will require authentication before making any changes, unless run by the superuser\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCHFN_RESTRICT\fR (string)
.RS 4
This parameter specifies which values in the
\fIgecos\fR
field of the
/etc/passwd
file may be changed by regular users using the

program\&. It can be any combination of letters
\fIf\fR,
\fIr\fR,
\fIw\fR,
\fIh\fR, for Full name, Room number, Work phone, and Home phone, respectively\&. For backward compatibility,
\fIyes\fR
is equivalent to
\fIrwh\fR
and
\fIno\fR
is equivalent to
\fIfrwh\fR\&. If not specified, only the superuser can make any changes\&. The most restrictive setting is better achieved by not installing
\fBchfn\fR
SUID\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCHSH_AUTH\fR (boolean)

.RE
.PP
\fBENCRYPT_METHOD\fR (string)
.RS 4
This defines the system default encryption algorithm for encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are specified on the command line)\&.
.sp
It can take one of these values:
\fIDES\fR
(default),
\fIMD5\fR, \fISHA256\fR, \fISHA512\fR\&.
.sp
Note: this parameter overrides the
\fBMD5_CRYPT_ENAB\fR
variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBENV_HZ\fR (string)
.RS 4
If set, it will be used to define the HZ environment variable when a user login\&. The value must be preceded by

.RS 4
If set, it will be used to define the TZ environment variable when a user login\&. The value can be the name of a timezone preceded by

\fITZ=CST6CDT\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBENVIRON_FILE\fR (string)

\fBnewusers\fR\&.
.sp
The default value for
\fBGID_MIN\fR
(resp\&.
\fBGID_MAX\fR) is 1000 (resp\&. 60000)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBHUSHLOGIN_FILE\fR (string)
.RS 4
If defined, this file can inhibit all the usual chatter during the login sequence\&. If a full pathname is specified, then hushed mode will be enabled if the user\*(Aqs name or shell are found in the file\&. If not a full pathname, then hushed mode will be enabled if the file exists in the user\*(Aqs home directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBISSUE_FILE\fR (string)

If defined, this file will be displayed before each login prompt\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Enable logging and display of /var/log/lastlog login time info\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLOG_OK_LOGINS\fR (boolean)
.RS 4
Enable logging of successful logins\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB\fR (boolean)
.RS 4
Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are recorded\&.
.sp
Note: logging unknown usernames may be a security issue if an user enter her password instead of her login name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLOGIN_RETRIES\fR (number)
.RS 4
Maximum number of login retries in case of bad password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLOGIN_STRING\fR (string)
.RS 4
The string used for prompting a password\&. The default is to use "Password: ", or a translation of that string\&. If you set this variable, the prompt will not be translated\&.
.sp
If the string contains
\fI%s\fR, this will be replaced by the user\*(Aqs name\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\fBMAIL_CHECK_ENAB\fR (boolean)

.sp
You should disable it if the shell startup files already check for mail ("mailx \-e" or equivalent)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMAIL_DIR\fR (string)
.RS 4
The mail spool directory\&. This is needed to manipulate the mailbox when its corresponding user account is modified or deleted\&. If not specified, a compile\-time default is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMAIL_FILE\fR (string)
.RS 4
Defines the location of the users mail spool files relatively to their home directory\&.
.RE
.PP
The
\fBMAIL_DIR\fR
and
\fBMAIL_FILE\fR
variables are used by
\fBuseradd\fR,
\fBusermod\fR, and
\fBuserdel\fR
to create, move, or delete the user\*(Aqs mail spool\&.
.PP
If
\fBMAIL_CHECK_ENAB\fR

\fIyes\fR, they are also used to define the
\fBMAIL\fR
environment variable\&.
.PP
\fBMAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP\fR (number)
.RS 4
Maximum members per group entry\&. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line) is started in
/etc/group
(with the same name, same password, and same GID)\&.
.sp
The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the number of members in a group\&.
.sp
This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in the group file\&. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters\&.
.sp
If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25\&.
.sp
Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the Shadow toolsuite)\&. You should not use this variable unless you really need it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMD5_CRYPT_ENAB\fR (boolean)
.RS 4
Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5\-based algorithm\&. If set to
\fIyes\fR, new passwords will be encrypted using the MD5\-based algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD\&. It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings\&. Set to
\fIno\fR
if you need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems which don\*(Aqt understand the new algorithm\&. Default is
\fIno\fR\&.
.sp
This variable is superseded by the
\fBENCRYPT_METHOD\fR
variable or by any command line option used to configure the encryption algorithm\&.
.sp
This variable is deprecated\&. You should use
\fBENCRYPT_METHOD\fR\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Maximum number of attempts to change password if rejected (too easy)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPASS_MAX_DAYS\fR (number)
.RS 4
The maximum number of days a password may be used\&. If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced\&. If not specified, \-1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPASS_MIN_DAYS\fR (number)
.RS 4
The minimum number of days allowed between password changes\&. Any password changes attempted sooner than this will be rejected\&. If not specified, \-1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPASS_WARN_AGE\fR (number)
.RS 4
The number of days warning given before a password expires\&. A zero means warning is given only upon the day of expiration, a negative value means no warning is given\&. If not specified, no warning will be provided\&.
.RE
.PP

\fBPASS_MAX_DAYS\fR,
\fBPASS_MIN_DAYS\fR
and
\fBPASS_WARN_AGE\fR
are only used at the time of account creation\&. Any changes to these settings won\*(Aqt affect existing accounts\&.
.PP
\fBPASS_MAX_LEN\fR (number), \fBPASS_MIN_LEN\fR (number)
.RS 4
Number of significant characters in the password for crypt()\&.
\fBPASS_MAX_LEN\fR
is 8 by default\&. Don\*(Aqt change unless your crypt() is better\&. This is ignored if
\fBMD5_CRYPT_ENAB\fR
set to
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPORTTIME_CHECKS_ENAB\fR (boolean)
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fBSHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS\fR (number), \fBSHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS\fR (number)
.RS 4
When
\fBENCRYPT_METHOD\fR
is set to
\fISHA256\fR
or
\fISHA512\fR, this defines the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption algorithm by default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the command line)\&.
.sp
With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the password\&. But note also that more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate users\&.
.sp
If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000)\&.
.sp
The values must be inside the 1000\-999,999,999 range\&.
.sp
If only one of the
\fBSHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS\fR
or
\fBSHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS\fR
values is set, then this value will be used\&.
.sp
If
\fBSHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS\fR
