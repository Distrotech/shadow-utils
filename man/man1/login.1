.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBlogin\fR
program is used to establish a new session with the system\&. It is normally invoked automatically by responding to the
\fIlogin:\fR
prompt on the user\*(Aqs terminal\&.
\fBlogin\fR
may be special to the shell and may not be invoked as a sub\-process\&. When called from a shell,
\fBlogin\fR
should be executed as
\fBexec login\fR
which will cause the user to exit from the current shell (and thus will prevent the new logged in user to return to the session of the caller)\&. Attempting to execute
\fBlogin\fR
from any shell but the login shell will produce an error message\&.
.PP
The user is then prompted for a password, where appropriate\&. Echoing is disabled to prevent revealing the password\&. Only a small number of password failures are permitted before
\fBlogin\fR
exits and the communications link is severed\&.
.PP
If password aging has been enabled for your account, you may be prompted for a new password before proceeding\&. You will be forced to provide your old password and the new password before continuing\&. Please refer to
\fBpasswd\fR(1)
for more information\&.
.PP
After a successful login, you will be informed of any system messages and the presence of mail\&. You may turn off the printing of the system message file,
/etc/motd, by creating a zero\-length file
\&.hushlogin
in your login directory\&. The mail message will be one of "\fIYou have new mail\&.\fR", "\fIYou have mail\&.\fR", or "\fINo Mail\&.\fR" according to the condition of your mailbox\&.
.PP
Your user and group ID will be set according to their values in the
/etc/passwd
file\&. The value for
\fB$HOME\fR,
\fB$SHELL\fR,
\fB$PATH\fR,
\fB$LOGNAME\fR, and
\fB$MAIL\fR
are set according to the appropriate fields in the password entry\&. Ulimit, umask and nice values may also be set according to entries in the GECOS field\&.
.PP
On some installations, the environmental variable
\fB$TERM\fR
will be initialized to the terminal type on your tty line, as specified in
/etc/ttytype\&.
.PP
An initialization script for your command interpreter may also be executed\&. Please see the appropriate manual section for more information on this function\&.
.PP
A subsystem login is indicated by the presence of a "*" as the first character of the login shell\&. The given home directory will be used as the root of a new file system which the user is actually logged into\&.
.PP
The
\fBlogin\fR
program is NOT responsible for removing users from the utmp file\&. It is the responsibility of
\fBgetty\fR(8)
and
\fBinit\fR(8)
to clean up apparent ownership of a terminal session\&. If you use
\fBlogin\fR
from the shell prompt without
\fBexec\fR, the user you use will continue to appear to be logged in even after you log out of the "subsession"\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Do not perform authentication, user is preauthenticated\&.
.sp
Note: In that case,
\fIusername\fR
is mandatory\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Name of the remote host for this login\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Preserve environment\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
The
\fB\-r\fR,
\fB\-h\fR
and
\fB\-f\fR
options are only used when
\fBlogin\fR
is invoked by root\&.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
This version of
\fBlogin\fR
has many compilation options, only some of which may be in use at any particular site\&.
.PP
The location of files is subject to differences in system configuration\&.
.PP
The
\fBlogin\fR
program is NOT responsible for removing users from the utmp file\&. It is the responsibility of
\fBgetty\fR(8)
and
\fBinit\fR(8)
to clean up apparent ownership of a terminal session\&. If you use
\fBlogin\fR
from the shell prompt without
\fBexec\fR, the user you use will continue to appear to be logged in even after you log out of the "subsession"\&.
.PP
As with any program,
\fBlogin\fR\*(Aqs appearance can be faked\&. If non\-trusted users have physical access to a machine, an attacker could use this to obtain the password of the next person coming to sit in front of the machine\&. Under Linux, the SAK mechanism can be used by users to initiate a trusted path and prevent this kind of attack\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The following configuration variables in
/etc/login\&.defs
change the behavior of this tool:
.PP
\fBCONSOLE\fR (string)
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fBDEFAULT_HOME\fR (boolean)
.RS 4

\fIPATH=/bin:/usr/bin\fR\&.

\fITZ=CST6CDT\fR), or the full path to the file containing the timezone specification (for example
/etc/tzname)\&.
.sp
If a full path is specified but the file does not exist or cannot be read, the default is to use
\fITZ=CST6CDT\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBENVIRON_FILE\fR (string)
.RS 4
If this file exists and is readable, login environment will be read from it\&. Every line should be in the form name=value\&.
.sp
Lines starting with a # are treated as comment lines and ignored\&.
.RE

.RS 4
If defined, this file will be displayed before each login prompt\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
The
\fBMAIL_DIR\fR
and
\fBMAIL_FILE\fR
variables are used by
\fBuseradd\fR,
\fBusermod\fR, and
\fBuserdel\fR
to create, move, or delete the user\*(Aqs mail spool\&.
.PP
If
\fBMAIL_CHECK_ENAB\fR

.RS 4
The terminal permissions: the login tty will be owned by the
\fBTTYGROUP\fR

.sp
By default, the ownership of the terminal is set to the user\*(Aqs primary group and the permissions are set to
\fI0600\fR\&.
.sp
\fBTTYGROUP\fR
can be either the name of a group or a numeric group identifier\&.
.sp
If you have a
\fBwrite\fR
program which is "setgid" to a special group which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group number and TTYPERM to 0620\&. Otherwise leave TTYGROUP commented out and assign TTYPERM to either 622 or 600\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBTTYTYPE_FILE\fR (string)
.RS 4

.sp
\fBuseradd\fR
and
\fBnewusers\fR
use this mask to set the mode of the home directory they create
.sp
It is also used by
\fBlogin\fR
to define users\*(Aq initial umask\&. Note that this mask can be overridden by the user\*(Aqs GECOS line (if
\fBQUOTAS_ENAB\fR
is set) or by the specification of a limit with the
\fIK\fR
identifier in
\fBlimits\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBUSERGROUPS_ENAB\fR (boolean)
.RS 4
Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits (examples: 022 \-> 002, 077 \-> 007) for non\-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name\&.
.sp
